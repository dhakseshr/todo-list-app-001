# Simple To-Do List Web Application

## Overview
This project is a straightforward and responsive To-Do List web application. It allows users to manage their tasks by providing functionalities to add new tasks, edit existing ones, mark tasks as complete, and delete them. The application utilizes the browser's `localStorage` to ensure that the task list persists even after the user closes or refreshes the browser, providing a seamless user experience.

## Setup
To set up and run this To-Do List application, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Save the file**: Copy the entire content of `index.html` and save it as `index.html` on your local machine.
2.  **Open in browser**: Double-click the `index.html` file, or drag and drop it into any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

There are no external dependencies or build tools required, making the setup process extremely simple.

## Usage
Once the `index.html` file is open in your browser, you can start managing your tasks immediately:

1.  **Add a Task**:
    *   Type your task into the input field labeled "Add a new task...".
    *   Click the "Add Task" button or press `Enter` on your keyboard.
    *   The new task will appear at the bottom of the list.

2.  **Mark Task as Complete**:
    *   Click the checkbox next to any task.
    *   The task text will be styled with a strikethrough, indicating it's completed. Unchecking the box will revert its status.

3.  **Edit a Task**:
    *   Click the "âœŽ" (pencil) icon next to the task you wish to edit.
    *   The task text will become editable.
    *   Type your changes directly into the task text area.
    *   Press `Enter` or click the "ðŸ’¾" (save) icon that replaced the pencil icon to save your changes. Clicking outside the editable area will also save.

4.  **Delete a Task**:
    *   Click the "âœ–" (cross) icon next to the task you want to remove.
    *   The task will be permanently deleted from your list.

All changes (adding, editing, completing, deleting) are automatically saved to your browser's `localStorage` and will be present when you next open the application.
